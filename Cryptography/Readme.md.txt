The crypto.py script is used to encrypt a plain text file(.txt) in Python. 
It uses python commands such as input, string, import, slicing, lists, for loops,
if statements, Dictionary and print functions. After learning about security,
I wanted to try and build my own script to encrypt and decrypt files and
this works as tested. I am open to feedback and suggestions.
